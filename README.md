### Background
Cyclistic has been a successful bike-share program since launching in 2016. The initiative has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked intoa network of 692 stations throughout Chicago. The variety of bikes can be unlocked at any station and returned to any other station at anytime.


The goal of this project is to distinguish the difference of how the different tiers of users are using the bikes actions between the different groups and derive actionable insights to convert the casual riders into annual members.
